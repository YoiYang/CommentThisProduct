# Random music instrument review generator

This is a C++ program that studies review data from Amazon in the musical instrument category. The main concept utilizes Markov's chain and numerous C++ built-in libraries. It studies the goodreview.txt and badreview.txt from the directory called "dat". After study, provided with the minimun length of the review you wanted, it randomly generates a good/bad review about music instruments.
